In order to apply this method, the number of clusters must first be determined. For this purpose, 24 different indices were evaluated using the NBClust-package. Among all indices:\n\n\n4 proposed 2 as the best number of clusters\n5 proposed 3 as the best number of clusters\n2 proposed 4 as the best number of clusters\n10 proposed 5 as the best number of clusters\n1 proposed 8 as the best number of clusters\n1 proposed 9 as the best number of clusters\n1 proposed 10 as the best number of clusters\n\nAccording to the majority rule, the best number of clusters is 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the data-distributions, the main characteristics of the clusters are summarized in the following table:\n\nCharacteristics of clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nDerived characteristics\n\n\n\n\n1\nRivers confined by anthropogenized floodplain\nRather confined, lower elevation rivers with altered riparian zone including diverse usages such as urban and agricultural infrastructure.\n\nabove average values: PC4, PC1\n\n\n\n2\nLarger rivers with agricultural landscape\nLarger rivers in wide valleys with low slopes and low elevations, with semi-intensive riparian corridor use due to agricultural activity.\n\nabove average values: PC1\nbelow average: PC2, PC4\n\n\n\n3\nSmall upstream rivers\nSmaller and unforested riparian corridors in higher elevations and with more natural open areas and grasslands and less activity in the adjacent areas.\n\nbelow average values: PC1, PC3\n\n\n\n4\nForested medium-sized rivers\nLarge and forested riparian corridors in lower elevations with few grassland and natural open area.\n\nabove average values: PC3\n\n\n\n5\nDiverse medium-sized and large rivers\nMedium-sized and larger streams in lower elevations with different landuse patterns and active channel sizes.\n\nabove average values: PC1, PC2, PC3"
